            For starters, IGOR is about love. Specifically: unrequited love. If you believe the general (though disputed)
             reddit/r/OFWGKTA consensus, for some time now Tyler has been in love with someone called Wyatt, 
             a nice looking young man previously seen in Instagram posts, interviews and paintings alongside T-dog. 
             Thematically, Igor follows a narrative of a love triangle between the titular character and his male love interest. 
             The album employs the "Igor" literary archetype to explore themes associated with love, such as heartbreak, loss, and 
             jealousy.

            <h4 class="h4 text-center">Acclaim</h4>
            <p class="text-center thoughts">
                Igor was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews 
                from professional publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 18 reviews.
                 Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.
                Roisin O'Connor of The Independent gave a positive review, stating "The production here is superb. 
                Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR he's like the Minotaur luring you through 
                a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown.
                This is Tyler's best work to date". Andy Kellman of AllMusic said, "Tyler and a motorcade's worth of supporting
                 vocalists fulfill the promise and threat with what plays out, 
                a creatively vital and emotionally heartsick set with as much pain, vulnerability,
                and compulsion as a classic soul LP". Danial Spielberger of HipHopDX saying "On IGOR, Tyler showcases a more
                 polished iteration of the hazy pop he's been perfecting for years. 
                Though some might be disappointed that he's becoming more of a singer than a rapper, this is the kind of project 
                that should encourage more artists to disavow labels and relish in taking risks".

            <h4>My Favorite Song (Earfquake)</h4>
            <p class="text-center thoughts">
                Tyler initially wrote the song for Canadian singer Justin Bieber, who turned down the song. 
                Tyler then asked Barbadian singer Rihanna to provide vocals to the hook believing the song would be big, 
                but she also rejected the song. 
                Tyler instead kept in his own raw vocals. "Earfquake" was initially leaked online on May 7, 2019.
                On the song “Earfquake”, Tyler, the Creator blames himself for the unstable state of his relationship with his lover. He acknowledges the fact that he may not have treated his woman the best way and this is causing her to lose interest. In an effort to patch things up, he tells her not to leave because it’s his fault.
                He likens the love he has for him to an earthquake which causes his world to shake, as the title “Earfquake” denotes.
                It appears he may have taken him for granted in the initial stages of their bond, but later realizes that he really needs him, both physically and emotionally.
